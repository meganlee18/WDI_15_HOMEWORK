# What is this?
This is a Games on Rails app created using Ruby on Rails. Play my game here - "link to be provided shortly"

# About my game
This is a homework task as part of the web development course at General Assembly.

The aim of the task is to build a game using Ruby on Rails and demonstrate our understanding and the implementation of the MVC framework.

Games include:
- Rock, Paper and Scissors
- Guessing secret number
- Magic Ball

Game is built using Ruby version 2.03.

# How it works

## Rock Paper Scissors
The game matches the player's choice and the computer's choice (randomly picked).

## Guessing the secret number
The game randomly picks a number between 1 to 10. User wins if the number matches to the number randomly picked by the computer.

## Magic Ball
The game randomly provides a response to the user's question.

# Improvements
Secret number - At the moment, the game works even if the user picks a number greater than 10. This will need to change.

Rock Paper Scissors - Icons, pictures will make this game more interesting

Magic Ball - Currently, the answers are randomly picked. It would be great if it could pick up certain keywords asked by the user and generate a closer, more relevant response.
